# 🎄 Premier League: The Christmas Curse Analysis

**Goal:** Answering the age-old question: *"Does being Top of the League at Christmas guarantee the title?"*

### 📊 Project Overview
I analyzed 30 years of Premier League data to test the "Christmas Champion" myth and profile the mental resilience of modern teams.

### 🛠 Tools Used
* **SQL (PostgreSQL):** CTEs, Window Functions, View creation, Temporal logic.
* **Visualization:** DataGrip & Slide Design.

### 💡 Key Findings
1.  **The Coin Flip:** Leading at Christmas only results in a title **53%** of the time.
2.  **The Safe Zone:** **77%** of all champions come from the Top 2 spots.
3.  **The Twist:** Since 2000, **Man City** has statistically proven to be the ultimate "Hunter" (winning from behind), while **Arsenal** has the highest "Bottling" rate (losing the lead).
